Malicious Software
"Malware" is software that aims to harm or get unapproved access to a computer, device, or network.

These requirements apply to your ads and any software that your site or app either hosts or links to, regardless of whether the software is promoted through the Google advertising network.

Violations of this policy are taken very seriously and are considered egregious. An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users. In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating this policy, Google may review information from multiple sources including your ad, website, accounts, and third-party sources.  If violations of this policy are found, your Google Ads accounts will be suspended upon detection and without prior warning, and you will not be allowed to advertise with Google Ads again. If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, submit an appeal and explain why. Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, and when there is good reason so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Learn more about suspended accounts.

Unwanted software
Any software that your site or app hosts or links to should provide a positive experience for users. Google’s Unwanted Software policy provides a few basic characteristics of software that are potentially harmful to the user experience which are listed below:

It is deceptive, promising a value proposition that it does not meet.
It tries to trick users into installing it or it piggybacks on the installation of another program.
It doesn’t tell the user about all of its principal and significant functions.
It affects the user’s system in unexpected ways.
It is difficult to remove.
It collects or transmits private information without the user’s knowledge.
It is bundled with other software and its presence is not disclosed.
