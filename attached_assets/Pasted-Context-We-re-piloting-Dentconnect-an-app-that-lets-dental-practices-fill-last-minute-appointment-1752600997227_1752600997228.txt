Context:
We're piloting Dentconnect, an app that lets dental practices fill last-minute appointment cancellations by offering them directly to their own patients. The app must fully comply with UK and EU legal, data protection, clinical, and regulatory standards (specifically: GDPR, CQC, GDC) to protect patients and the clinic.

Instructions:
Please review, update, or add the following features and processes to the Dentconnect app. All requirements must be met for full legal and regulatory compliance in England:

1. Data Protection (GDPR, UK Data Law)
Implement a privacy notice visible during sign-up and accessible at all times, explaining:

What personal and health data is collected

The purpose and lawful basis for processing (including special category health data)

Details on storage, access, retention, sharing, and deletion of data

Add explicit, user-friendly consent mechanisms for all uses of personal data, especially special category data and communications (SMS/email). Users must be able to withdraw consent easily from within the app.

Apply data minimization: only collect data essential for the booking/triage processes.

Ensure secure storage and transmission (encryption, access controls, use of secure cloud services compliant with UK/EU law).

Enable users to see, correct, and request deletion of their data within the app.

Implement a process/protocol for data breaches, including user and ICO notification.

Maintain an internal record of processing activities (ROPA) covering all data lifecycle stages.

2. Clinical Governance, Safety & CQC
Add structured symptom and urgency assessments (triage): When booking, users must answer questions about symptoms/pain (e.g., pain scale, duration, swelling/trauma.

Add a element in the dental dashboard that allows the dentist to select and approve the patients that have booked their available slots. show a summary of symptom and urgency assessment to allow for triaging of patients.

Add an audit log: all system and booking activities must be logged (who did what, when).


All confirmed/cancelled appointments, triage notes, messages, and changes must be written back to patient records - add function to generate pdf summary on dentist dashboard

Provide for clinical oversight: allow a dentist/nurse to review and approve red-flagged cases before confirming bookings.
