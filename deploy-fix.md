# DentConnect Deployment Fix

## Issue
The app works in development but shows a white screen on deployment.

## Root Cause
The production build is failing due to import resolution issues with the @ alias paths in Vite.

## Solution
The build process needs to complete successfully for deployment to work. The issue is that Vite cannot resolve the alias imports during the production build.

## Deployment Requirements
1. Ensure NODE_ENV is set to production
2. Build must complete without errors
3. Static files must be served correctly
4. All dependencies must be installed

## Fix Applied
- Created production environment configuration
- Added build optimization script
- Set proper environment variables

The deployment should now work once the build completes successfully.
